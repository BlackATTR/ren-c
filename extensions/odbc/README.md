Circa 9-Oct-2019, the ODBC extension is being migrated to its own repository,
so that it has a separate issue tracker and continuous integration script.

As an interim step, before bringing about the complexity of "submodules"
and the versioning questions that brings up...the code for the extension
is still kept here.  However, the tests and documentation have moved to:
