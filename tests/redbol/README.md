"Redbol" is intended to be a consensus-based emulation of the common
subset of Rebol2, R3-Alpha, and Red...with a bias toward picking
compatibility with Rebol2 or Red.  The focus is not on having the
best answer (because that's the default).  Rather, the module's
purpose is to make it easier to run unmodified code from those systems.
