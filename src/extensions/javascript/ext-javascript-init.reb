; !!! The table which maps ID numbers to JavaScript functions that implement
; JS-NATIVEs has to live on the GUI thread.  But when running rebPromise(),
; that Rebol code runs on the worker thread...which includes the ordinary
; native for registering JavaScript natives.
;
; As a temporary workaround, this makes JS-NATIVE JavaScript code itself.
; That does enough to jump it to the main thread, where it calls the form
; of the main thread internal native creator.
