; If they installed libtcc with `sudo apt-get libtcc-dev`, then the switches
; for `-ltcc` and `#include "libtcc.h" should just work.  Otherwise, they
; have to do `export LIBTCC_INCLUDE_DIR=...` and `export LIBTCC_LIB_DIR=...`
;
; But for convenience, we try to use CONFIG_TCCDIR if they have that set *and*
; it has %libtcc.h in it.  Then it's *probably* a directory TCC was cloned
; and built in--not just where the helper library libtcc1.a was installed.
