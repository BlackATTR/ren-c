    Description: {
        The goal of the debugger in Ren-C is to be mostly usermode code, and
        to rely on leveraging exposure of the FRAME! datatype.  One of the
        concepts involved in that is that things like mappings of integers
        to frames is all part of the userspace code's responsibility.

        Original code was in C, but is being migrated out.
